The DOI itself is an alphanumberic character sequence, written in a standardized syntax with two main parts: prefix and suffix (Figure 1). 

The prefix starts with '10.' followed by a numeric code representing the code of a particular information provider. In the example below, the prefix 10.7935 represents the LIGO Open Science Center, a division of Caltech who was assigned the prefix code by the DOI Registration Agency DataCite. 

A forward slash separates the prefix from the suffix.

The suffix represents a unique string that the information provider assigns to each resource it wishes to associate with a DOI. The information provider must supply metadata about the information resource to the DOI Registration Agency (including the URL for the resource on the Web) in order for the DOI to be officially registered and operational.
