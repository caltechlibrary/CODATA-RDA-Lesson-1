## What are Digital Object Identifiers and Why Do They Matter ?
---

Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs) are unique names assigned to information resources that are represented in some way on the Internet. The DOI distinguishes the information resource from others, and also  provides a persistent link to its representation on the Internet. When put in URL form, the DOI automatically redirects the user to a landing page that offers information about the resource and often a link to the resource itself.  Whether or not a user can click through the landing page to fetch the resource itself may depend on a host of circumstances unrelated to DOIs: format of the resource, restrictions and conditions governing access; authentication requirements; software compatibility; etc. What the DOI does guarantee is that information about the resource will be always available to everyone. 

Information resources that are assigned DOIs are typically of enduring value, likely to be used and cited by others, and are maintained by a publisher or other information provider who is committed to curating and preserving the resource over time. Examples of research-related information resources assigned DOIs include journal articles, curated datasets, theses, conference papers, and books.
