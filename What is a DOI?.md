##What is a Digital Object Identifier and Why Do They Matter ?

/n
Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs) are unique names assigned to information resources that are usually (but not necessarily) located on the Internet. The DOI not only distinguishes the resource from others, but also  provides a persistent link to its representation on the Internet. When put in URL form, the DOI automatically redirects the user to a landing page that offers information about the resource. 

Information resources that are assigned DOIs are typically of enduring value, likely to be used and cited by others, and are maintained by a publisher or other information provider who is committed to curating and preserving the resource over time. Examples of information resources assigned DOIs are journal articles, curated datasets, theses, conference papers, and even creative works
