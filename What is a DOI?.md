## What are Digital Object Identifiers and Why Do They Matter ?
---

Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs) are unique names assigned to information resources that are represented in some way on the Internet. The actual object represented by the DOI can be a physical, digital, or abstract entity. The DOI not only distinguishes the given information resource from others, but also  provides a persistent link to its representation on the Internet. When put in URL form, the DOI automatically redirects the user to a landing page that offers information about the resource. Whether or not a user can obtain the resource itself from the landing page depends on a host of circumstances: format of the resource, restrictions and conditions governing access; authentication requirements; etc.

Information resources that are assigned DOIs are typically of enduring value, likely to be used and cited by others, and are maintained by a publisher or other information provider who is committed to curating and preserving the resource over time. Examples of information resources assigned DOIs are journal articles, curated datasets, theses, conference papers, and even music and printed books.
