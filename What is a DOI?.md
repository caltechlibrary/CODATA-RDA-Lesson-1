## Module 1A. What are Digital Object Identifiers and Why Do They Matter ?
---

Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs) are unique names assigned to information resources that are represented in some way on the Internet. The DOI distinguishes the information resource from others (including other versions of the same intellectual work!). The DOI also provides a persistent web link to a representation of that information on the Internet. When put in URL form (http://dx.doi.org/{DOI}, the DOI automatically redirects the user to a landing page that offers information about the resource and often a link to the resource itself.  

The DOI is NOT by itself an indicator of open access content or a seal of quality. Information resources that are assigned DOIs are typically of enduring value, likely to be used and cited by others, and are maintained by a publisher or other information provider who is committed to curating and preserving the resource over time. Examples of research-related information resources assigned DOIs include journal articles, curated datasets, theses, conference papers, and books.

A DOI is considered a persistent identifier because it reliably resolves to a human- and machine-readable landing page for the information resource. 
Whether or not a user can click through the landing page to fetch the resource itself depends on various circumstances unrelated to the DOI system: format of the resource, restrictions and conditions governing access; authentication requirements; software compatibility; etc. 

The [DOI System](https://www.doi.org/) is the overall infrastructure by which digital object identifiers are assigned, registered, resolved, and associated with valuable metadata including citation, availability of full text, funder information,  licensing information, and more. The following components of the DOI System together make it work.
* [The International DOI Federation (IDF)](http://www.doi.org/doi_handbook/7_IDF.html) is responsible for the overall governance of the system. IDF is a not-for-profit membership organization that oversees the operations of the federation of Registration Agencies which providing Digital Object Identifier (DOI) services and registration. IDF is also the registration authority for the ISO standard (ISO 26324) for the DOI system.
* [Registration Agencies](https://www.doi.org/registration_agencies.html) provide services to Registrants â€” allocating DOI name prefixes, registering DOI names and providing the necessary infrastructure to allow Registrants to declare and maintain metadata and state data. Some RAs (e.g., CrossRef) include web searches of DOIs and associated metadata for researchers and public users. 
* [Registrants](http://google.com) become members of a given Registration Agency in order to to register DOIs for information resources under their responsibility. Registrants include publishers, data centers, universities, libraries, university presses, and more. Registrants must follow the policies and procedures established by the RA in order to register DOIs. Each Registrant is given a unique code that forms the prefix of the DOI sequence. The Registrant then uses the suffix portion of the DOI sequence to assign unique names to each resource they manage.  For example, CODA serves as publisher for the Data Science Journal. CODATA DOIs for the articles inthis journal share the prefix 10.5334/.
