##**Module 1C. How do I get a Digital Object Identifier (DOI) for my material?**

You have two options: 

+ Use the services of an existing Registrant, such as a Publisher, Library, or Data Center who is assisting you with disseminating and preserving your research outputs. If you aren't working with one of these RAs, you can submit your work to an open research sharing system such as Zenodo where your ubmission is assigned a DOI, archived, and disseminated over the open Web.

+ Alternatively, your organization can join a DOI Registration Agency (RA) and become a DOI Registrant. This commitment requires an investment of time, infrastructure, funds, and human resources to ensure that registered DOIs are maintained and revised as content changes or moves. Information about becoming a DOI registration is available from the DOI Foundation.
