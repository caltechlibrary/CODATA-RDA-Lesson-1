##**Module 1C. Metadata associated with DOIs**##
---
When works are registered with DOI Registration Agencies, the Registrant (publisher, data center, or other information provider) is required to submit metadata about the resource. Each Registration Agency maintains its own metadata schema and establishes rules for requiring and populating the metadata elements.   

Each Registration Agency also has the option of offering metadata look up and harvesting services that researchers may query. At a minimum, a basic citation for each DOI-assigned work includes creator, title, publisher, publication year. Additional metadata may include references cited in the work; funding sources; author ORCiD numbers; and more.

Researchers may search for metadata associated with DOIs in various ways.  This module demonstrates how to use the API services of two Registration Agencies -- CrossRef and DataCite -- to query and retrieve valuable metadata about research outputs.
